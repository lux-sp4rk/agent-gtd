description: "Executive function system for AI agents: GTD-style task management, error/learning capture, and periodic self-review using Taskwarrior. Use when: (1) tracking multi-step goals or internal agent tasks, (2) logging command failures, user corrections, or missing capabilities, (3) running a self-improvement or review loop, (4) managing continuity across sessions, (5) triaging a backlog of agent work. Reference implementation uses Taskwarrior; patterns are portable to other task backends."

# Agent GTD

A complete executive function stack for AI agents. Three layers working together:

| Layer | Tool | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **RAM** | Taskwarrior | Actionable tasks, current focus, backlog |
| **Hard Drive** | Markdown files | Context, decisions, lore, "why" |
| **Workbench** | `ops/session_state.md` | What I was doing 5 seconds ago |

Rule of thumb: task to finish → Taskwarrior. Fact to remember → Markdown. Mid-task state → session_state.

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Add to inbox
task add +in "thing to process"

# Triage inbox
task +in list

# Add internal task
task add project:Internal "description" +next priority:M

# Log a failure
task add project:Internal.Learnings +error "what broke"
task annotate <id> "fix: what resolved it"

# See what's next
task next

# Run a review
# → follow references/review-runbook.md
```

---

## 1. The Inbox (Capture)

Everything goes into the inbox first. No processing at capture time.

```bash
task add +in "description"
task in   # custom report: lists all +in items
```

Inbox items carry high urgency (+15.0) to surface in default reports.

---

## 2. Triage Flow

For each item in `task in`:

1. **Actionable?** No → delete or annotate as reference.
2. **< 2 minutes?** Do it now, mark done.
3. **Multi-step?** Create a `project:` and tag the first step `+next`.
4. **Delegate?** Tag `+waiting`, add `wait:` date, annotate who/what.
5. **Defer?** Assign project, tag `+next`, move on.

---

## 3. Project Taxonomy

```
Internal           # Agent-internal work
  Internal.Ops     # Infra, config, tooling
  Internal.Learnings  # Errors, corrections, feature gaps
Goals              # High-level strategic goals
<ProjectName>      # Active user projects
  <ProjectName>.Ops
```

---

## 4. Task Attributes

```bash
priority:H / M / L          # Impact
brainpower:H / M / L        # Cognitive load (H=architecture, L=routine)
estimate:<minutes>           # Time budget
wait:<date>                  # Snooze (hide until date)
due:<date>                   # Hard deadline
```

**Selection pattern:**
```bash
task next brainpower:L estimate:5    # Quick wins
task next brainpower:H priority:H   # Deep work
```

---

## 5. Error & Learning Capture

Log immediately. Don't wait for review time.

| Situation | Tag | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Command / tool fails | `+error` | `task add project:Internal.Learnings +error "git push rejected: token expired"` |
| User corrects agent | `+learning` | `task add project:Internal.Learnings +learning "pnpm not npm on this project"` |
| Missing capability | `+featreq` | `task add project:Internal.Learnings +featreq "user wanted calendar invite generation"` |

Use `task annotate <id> "..."` for fix details or stack traces.

**Promotion rule:** 3+ recurrences of the same pattern in 30 days → promote fix to `TOOLS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `SOUL.md`. Mark task done, note promotion target in final annotation.

```bash
# Query learnings
task project:Internal.Learnings list
task +error list
task +error +<area> list
```

---

## 6. Backlog Triage

Run when the task list exceeds ~20 items or burndown stalls.

### Tickler / Think Pattern
```bash
# Snooze: hide until a future date
task add +tickle wait:2025-03-01 "revisit X"

# Deferred decision: force a yes/no when it resurfaces
task add +tickle +think wait:+3d "Should I do Y? (yes/no)"
```
**No double-snooze rule:** when a `+think` task resurfaces, decide immediately. No re-snoozing.

### Rule of 3
Pick only **3 tasks per day** to actually finish during autonomous chew-through. Focus beats volume. Prioritize:
1. Anything blocking other tasks (dependency-first)
2. Low-hanging fruit solvable in < 5 min (`exec`, `edit`, `web_search`)
3. Highest-urgency `+next` task

### Priority Pivot
When project focus shifts, bulk-modify to keep the list honest:
```bash
task project:OldProject modify -next priority:L
task project:NewProject modify +next priority:H
```

### Age-Out Rule
Tasks older than 14 days with no progress → cold storage:
```bash
task <id> export >> memory/backlog.md && task <id> delete
```
Tasks starting with "Maybe" or "Explore" untouched for 7 days → delete without ceremony.

---

## 7. Witness Gates (High-Stakes Actions)

Tag destructive or irreversible tasks `+gate`. Do not auto-complete them.

```bash
task add project:Internal +gate "push to main branch"
```

When a `+gate` task completes: pause, notify the human, wait for explicit approval before marking done.

---

## 8. Periodic Review

Run at natural breakpoints: session start, after completing a feature, weekly.

→ See `references/review-runbook.md` for the full runbook.

**Quick review (< 5 min):**
```bash
task +in list          # clear inbox
task +error list       # any unresolved failures?
task next              # confirm focus is right
task project:Internal.Learnings +error status:pending list  # promote if 3+ recurrences
```

---

## 9. Session Continuity

**Workbench cycle** — the explicit protocol for `ops/session_state.md`:

1. **Pick** — select a task from `task next`
2. **Log** — write to `ops/session_state.md`: task ID, what you're doing, last file touched
3. **Work** — execute
4. **Done** — mark complete in Taskwarrior (`task done <id>`)
5. **Wipe** — reset `ops/session_state.md` to idle state

```bash
cat ops/session_state.md        # on session start: where was I?
task active                     # any task already started?
```

Minimal `ops/session_state.md` format:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Focus: <task description> (#<id>)
Last action: <what was done>
Open loops: <anything unfinished>
Blockers: <none | description>
```

## 10. Vitality Heartbeat

Monitor agent activity and alert on sustained silence during mission hours.

```bash
python3 references/vitality_check.py   # run manually
# or: cron every hour during mission hours
```

→ See `references/vitality-heartbeat.md` for implementation.
